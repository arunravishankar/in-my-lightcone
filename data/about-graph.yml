    description: "My PhD research investigated a subtle but fundamental instability that occurs at extremal black hole horizons. I was fascinated by understanding the physical mechanisms behind this phenomenon - why certain perturbations get trapped near the horizon for parametrically long times before falling in. Using simplified models like the BTZ black hole as a theoretical playground, I discovered this instability is connected to special null geodesic trajectories that spiral around the black hole many times before crossing the horizon. Extending to more realistic geometries, I found this horizon instability plays a crucial role in holographic duality, being essential for maintaining semi-local quantum criticality in dual field theories and connecting black hole physics to critical phenomena, power laws, and phase transitions."

In my research, I used the extremal BTZ as a tractable playground to understand the Aretakis instability, developing time-domain techniques to construct the retarded Green function using the method of images. I solved the null geodesic equation in full generality and demonstrated that the horizon instability arises from a specific class of null geodesics that orbit near the event horizon arbitrarily many times before falling in, providing the first clear physical interpretation of how perturbations get trapped near extremal horizons."

    description: "A counterintuitive instability of extremal black hole horizons where field perturbations decay everywhere except precisely on the horizon, where transverse derivatives grow polynomially with time. This instability was surprising because extremal black holes were thought to be stable. My work extended understanding of this phenomenon from compact to planar horizon geometries, showing it persists in cases relevant to holography. I demonstrated the physical mechanism: null geodesics that spend parametrically long times near the horizon before falling in, effectively trapping perturbations and causing the mathematical growth of derivatives at the horizon boundary."

    description: "Universal behavior near phase transitions characterized by power laws, scaling symmetries, and emergent conformal invariance. My early exposure to phase transitions and the renormalization group in statistical physics fascinated me with how simple microscopic rules could give rise to universal macroscopic behavior. When my black hole research revealed unexpected connections to critical phenomena - with horizon instabilities corresponding to semi-local quantum criticality in dual field theories - it deepened my appreciation for how these universal patterns emerge across vastly different physical systems. This sparked my broader interest in universality and emergent phenomena beyond physics: scaling laws in neural network training, phase transitions in multi-agent systems, market dynamics, and collective behavior. The mathematical signatures of criticality - power laws, scale invariance, emergent symmetries - appear remarkably consistently across seemingly disparate domains, suggesting deep underlying principles governing complex emergent behavior."

This became a key part of how I think about physics problems. Even though my research shifted from self-force to black hole stability, Sam was an excellent advisor who taught me rigorous mathematical techniques and helped me develop physical intuition about gravitational phenomena."

However, it quickly became clear that fully appreciating the correspondence requires deep expertise in string theory, which remained beyond my reach. Nevertheless, my black hole work provided a window into specific aspects of the duality, particularly how bulk horizon physics maps to boundary critical phenomena, giving me a taste of its remarkable depth while highlighting how much remains to be understood."

This approach starts with basic axioms about how nature works and derives conclusions through mathematical frameworks - like Bohmian mechanics providing a deterministic foundation for quantum mechanics, or general relativity emerging from the equivalence principle. Most of theoretical physics follows this pattern: propose fundamental rules and work out their consequences. I apply this thinking beyond physics too, like in agent-based modeling where I start by defining what individual agents do in a market and then see what emergent phenomena arise, rather than just observing patterns and stopping there. This approach appeals to me because it seeks to understand the underlying mechanisms that generate observed behavior."

This is the approach of statistics, machine learning, and AI - you begin with data and try to infer patterns, relationships, or models that explain what you observe. Rather than starting with theoretical axioms, you let the data guide you toward understanding. This empirical approach has become central to my work in data science, where the goal is often to extract insights directly from observed behavior without necessarily having a complete theoretical framework beforehand. Both approaches are valuable, and much of my current work involves bridging between them - using bottom-up insights to inform data-driven models and using empirical findings to guide theoretical understanding."

The foundations of quantum mechanics also fascinated me - the measurement problem, the role of the observer, and what different interpretations like Bohmian mechanics might tell us about the nature of reality. These philosophical inquiries complemented my technical physics work by forcing me to think carefully about what our mathematical frameworks actually mean and what they imply about the world. Understanding the conceptual foundations helped clarify why certain approaches in physics are compelling and what assumptions we're making when we adopt particular theoretical frameworks."
