    description: "The first original question I asked and tried to follow through - Maxwell's equations are asymmetric since there are no magnetic monopoles. What would the mathematical theory look like if we posit their existence, and what would the consequences be? As it turned out, I realized this was a very old question Dirac had already asked."
