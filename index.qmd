## Why "In My Lightcone"?
In physics, a lightcone represents all the events in spacetime that can causally influence or be influenced by a given point. It's the boundary of what can affect you and what you can affect. I chose this name because this blog is about the ideas, experiences and connections within m own sphere of influence and interest.

## What you'll find here
My curiosity spans an unusually wide range of topics, and this blog is where I hope to methodically document what I'm learning and thinking about. It serves two purposes: helping me reflect on and consolidate my own ideas, and sharing parts of my journey that might be useful to others who stumble upon this corner of the internet.
My current interests include:

- **Game Theory & Economics** - Optimal play in games, price discovery & auction design

- **AI & ML** - Recommendation systems, Memory in LLM Agents

- **Decision Science** - Experimentation

- **Systems & Emergence** - Complex systems, emergent phenomena

## Join the conversation
This isn't just a one-way broadcast. I'm hoping to connect with fellow curious minds—researchers switching fields, builders exploring new domains, or anyone who gets excited about understanding how systems work.
If something I write sparks a thought, challenges your perspective, or reminds you of your own journey, I'd love to hear about it. The best insights often come from unexpected conversations with people who see things differently.
