## To Do
* Clean up the codebase
* Allow for system to decide on light vs dark theme
* Ensure auto deploy on the custom domain when a PR is merged onto main
* Finish the description of each node
* Decide what node needs to be in the Overview section
* Recenter the screen at the same zoom level to the center of mass of the nodes that are in the view selection.
* Ensure that texts do not overlap - this can be done by making sure nodes move around a bit in the y axis such that nearby nodes don't have overlapping y axis coordinates
* Add my photo on the home page also.
* Edit the contents of the About page.
