It serves two purposes: helping me reflect on and consolidate my own ideas, and sharing parts of my journey that might be useful to others who stumble upon this corner of the internet. My current interests include:\n\nGame Theory & Economics - Optimal play in games, price discovery & auction design\nAI & ML - Recommendation systems, Memory in LLM Agents\nDecision Science - Experimentation\nSystems & Emergence - Complex systems, emergent phenomena"

I’m hoping to connect with fellow curious minds—researchers switching fields, builders exploring new domains, or anyone who gets excited about understanding how systems work. If something I write sparks a thought, challenges your perspective, or reminds you of your own journey, I’d love to hear about it. The best insights often come from unexpected conversations with people who see things differently.\nEmail: arunravishankar@gmail.com\nLinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/arunravishankar"
