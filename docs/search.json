    "section": "The Journey",
    "text": "The Journey\nCuriosity about the quantum foundations took me from India to Munich, where I worked with the late Detlef Dürr on Bohmian mechanics. His research group was full of people who were inquisitive, and deeply cared about the work they did. This was where I started looking at systems with the bottom-up approach — figuring out how to formulate a theory that ontologically describes how nature works at a fundamental level, with the constraints of having to describe known phenomena.\nI went to Tucson planning to work with Sam Gralla on the self-force problem, but ended up getting sucked into black hole physics instead. The PhD years in Arizona were intense in ways I didn’t expect. I got really good at sitting with hard problems for months without making progress, then suddenly seeing the path forward. Somewhere along the way, I also started caring about the math itself, not just what it could tell me about black holes.\nThen Schnucki showed up with those brown eyes and infinite capacity for love, and suddenly being with her in a place where she could run around freely became a priority. Seattle called — I’m a sucker for gloomy, drizzly weather and the beautiful outdoors. I was fortunate to find my first position outside academia at Rover, working with genuinely amazing people, and everything clicked differently. Instead of “What fundamental dynamics make this happen?” I started asking “What can we actually figure out from messy, real-world data?”. I went from exact solutions and clean equations to thinking in distributions and probabilities. Turns out that adding programming to your toolkit allows you to ask questions that you’d never even think of asking if you didn’t have those techniques under your belt.\nLong-term immigration stability brought me to Vancouver in 2024. Now I’m doing Stanford’s AI program while consulting for Turno (another 2-sided marketplace, because apparently I have a type). These days I’m obsessed with where game theory, reinforcement learning, and economics overlap — it’s this sweet spot where bottom-up and top-down thinking actually play nice together. And yeah, like everyone else, I’m trying to figure out what to do with large language models."

The stronger the connection, the more direct the influence. You’ll notice that geographic moves often coincided with major career transitions, and that the bottom-up thinking approach from quantum foundations continues to influence my current work in AI and game theory.\nThe questions keep changing, but I’m still just as curious about complex systems — whether they’re quantum foundations, black holes, markets, or whatever’s next."

This will involve learning game theory fundamentals, depending on the game structure.\nPrice discovery and auction design - How do individuals behave with limited information and cognitive biases in auctions? How does auction design influence whether the final transaction value reflects actual value? This pulls me into mechanism design, behavioral economics, and understanding how market structure affects outcomes.\nRecommendation systems - I’m particularly curious about how these systems create user bubbles and whether there are ways to resolve this inherent property without destroying the user experience.\nExperimentation - Bayesian approaches in experimentation and when they’re a useful addition to your toolkit as a data scientist.\nMemory in LLMs - Knowledge graphs, graph databases, and ways to store and retrieve memory for AI agents in a cheap, quick and efficient way. I want to learn about semantic search, knowledge graphs, and other memory architectures.\nThese topics will definitely shift over time. That’s kind of the point."
